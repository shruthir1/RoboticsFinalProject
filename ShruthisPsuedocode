NAVIGATION NODE 
//path planning creating routes and overall controls robot movement 
//navigate to initial human positionings obtained from detection node 
//navigate towards the footprints 




DETECTION NODE 
//orignal and new map are read and compared here. Inital human positions are stored here 
//footprints are discovered here by comparing whats expected from /map and data we're collecting from /scan with respect to /amcl_pose
//send this footprint data to navigation node to keep moving in that direction (record the direction where we see more footprints)
//when we find new human pos through /scan we record these coordinates and send to nav 

load original map 
initalHumansX = [] //or we can store it in variables too! 
intialHumansY = []

for i < humans:
    send (x,y) to nav 







ALL TOPICS BEING USED
-/map 
    this is where the orignal map and new map are coming from 
-/amcl_pose
    this is where the x and y coordinates of the robot are obtained
-/
    this is where sensor readings will be availble 
-/cmd_vel
  this is where the robots movement is controlled
