 Locomotion (moving)
    [] Nav2 integration
    [] Based on navigation
    -MOVES BASED ON "WHERE TO GO"
subscribes to navigation node


 Navigation (knowing where you are)
    [] Nav2 integration
    [] Reference map utilized here 
    [] Obstacle avoidance -> already part of nav2
    [] Following footprints extracted from /map topic 
    - DECIDES WHERE TO GO
subscribes to perception node 
publishes to locomotion node 

Perception (knowing where the humans are)
    [] Checking for map anomalies 
    [] Marking human locations, extracting coordinates
    -estimates next human pose and feeds into nav node 

publishes human pose to Navigation node 


Navigation: obtain coordinates of discrepnecies, obtain original human cooridinates, 

Locomotion: responsible for getting coordinates from nav and moving the robot
